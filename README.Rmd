The `duflor.gui`-package contains a shiny-application built for the use of the `duflor`-package.

## Installation

This package requires the installation of the `duflor`-package, which implements most of the back-end code for the analysis-pipelines in this application.

### Prerequisites

#### Install `renv`

As this application is quite complex, it relies on a certain number of packages to work. The package `renv` can help with managing a reproducible package environment for a project. As an additional advantage, this also prevents packages in your system-library from being updated when installing this package.

For a proper documentation and information on its use-cases, refer to <https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html>.

To set up a stand-alone R-project with renv, the easiest way is through R-Studio:

1.  Go to `File` \> `New Project`.
2.  Select `New Directory`.
3.  Select `New Project` as project-type[^1].
4.  Give a distinct name to the project, e.g. `duflor.gui_installed`[^2].
5.  Choose a location for the R-project.
6.  [**Make sure that the checkbox `Use renv with this project` is checked.**]{.underline}
7.  Make sure the checkbox `Open in new session` is checked.
8.  Create the project.

[^1]: This might sound confusing, as this is a R-package wrapping a shiny-application. However, those two options are for ***developing*** either of those, not for ***installing***Â them.

[^2]: The name is not really important, but it should be distinct and indicate that this is the installed application

From now on, this project can be opened from within R-Studio via the project-selection drop-down-menu in the top-right corner of the RStudio-application.

Before continuing, open this project if you did not do so.

#### Install `devtools`

First of all, make sure to have followed the steps outlined in "[Install renv]", and that RStudio is currently in your created project.

Installing this package from GitHub requires the installation of the R-package `devtools`. `devtools` can be used to compile source-packages to installed binaries.

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
```

When being asked to proceed, make sure that the installation-path is in the R-project you created:

If I created my R-project with `renv` at

```         
C:/Users/User_Main/Desktop/TempTemporal/test_duflorgui_install
```

, the path would look something like

```         
C:/Users/User_Main/Desktop/TempTemporal/test_duflorgui_install/renv/library/R-X.Y/....
```

If this is correct, you can go ahead and answer the prompt with `Y`. If this is not the case, install devtools via the RStudio-GUI:

1.  Open the `packages`-panel.
2.  Search for and select `devtools`.
3.  Under "Install to library", make sure the path selected is similar to the example outlined above. In other words, make sure you do **not** install to the library containing the string `R/cache/R/renv/sandbox`.

Once you have installed `renv`, go on to "[Installing application itself]".

### Installing application itself

Both the `duflor`- and `duflor.gui`-packages must be installed from their respective GitHub-repositories.

You can install the development and release versions of `duflor.gui` like so:

``` r
# release:
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/Claudius-Appel/duflor.gui@master")
# development version:
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/Claudius-Appel/duflor.gui@dev")
```

As with installing `devtools`, make sure the `renv`-library is selected when installing the package.

### Installing help-vignettes

The application is documented in detail via pkgdown, and its site can be reached from the github-repository.

Most of the articles outlined on the site may also be viewed as vignettes from within RStudio. To do so, you must explicitly declare vignettes to be installed:

``` r
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/Claudius-Appel/duflor.gui@master"
  ,build_vignettes = T)
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/Claudius-Appel/duflor.gui@dev"
  ,build_vignettes = T)
```

Vignettes are rendered documents discussing specific topics within a package. Installing them is recommended, but not required for utilizing the package itself.
