# The problem

When taking images of a pot in a photo-box, there are frequently regions within the image which are of no relevance to the results. Figure 1 displays a typical photo which will be analysed. Please ignore the rectangle around the pink identifier-dot, as well as the information printed in the top-left corner for now.

![Fig.1: A typical full-scale image showing the pot, the identifier-dot and large regions of plain photo-box background](../man/figures/in_identifier_selection_grabber.png)

Large regions to the left, right and top of the plant and pink dot are completely irrelevant to the analysis. These pixels can be happily ignored. In fact, *not excluding* them would result in unnecessary iterations during the analysis, which can significantly increase the time required for an analysis to complete.\
This time-loss increases linearly with the number of analysed images.

# The solution

To counteract this, the GUI allows you to select a rectangular sub-set of the full image which will be analysed instead.

To select the area, follow the steps outlined below. Each step corresponds to a number within figures 2 and 3:

1.  Select an image to inspect. You may select any one image within the Image Files-Tab
2.  Check the check-box to enable this feature. This will expand a previously-hidden panel.
3.  Next, press the button Select area to analyse to launch the window shown in figure 3.
4.  Finally, left-click-and-drag over the area within which both the plant **and the identifier-dot** reside. The selection may contain anything else, and may be of any size. When you let go, the selection-GUI will close, and the bounding coordinates will be inserted into the respective numeric input controls.
